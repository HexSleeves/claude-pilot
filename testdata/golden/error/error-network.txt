Error: Failed to connect to backend service

The multiplexer backend (tmux) is not available or not responding.

Troubleshooting steps:
  1. Check if tmux is installed: tmux -V
  2. Verify tmux server is running: tmux list-sessions
  3. Check system resources and permissions
  4. Try restarting the backend service

If the problem persists, check the logs with --debug flag.
