  3. Feedback and Recommendations

  While the project is well-structured, there are a few areas that could be consolidated or improved.

  Consolidation and Removal:

* `internal/ui/renderer.go`: This file seems to be an attempt at a more abstract rendering system, but it's not fully utilized and adds unnecessary complexity. The
     existing ui/colors.go and ui/table.go are sufficient for the current CLI needs. I recommend removing renderer.go and refactoring the ui package to be simpler.
* Redundant Session Status Logic: There's some duplication in how session status is determined. The SessionService updates the session status based on the
     multiplexer's state, but the ui/table.go also has logic to determine the multiplexer status. This logic should be centralized in the SessionService to ensure
     consistency.
  Potential Improvements:

* Error Handling: The error handling is generally good, but it could be more consistent. Some errors are simply printed to the console, while others cause the
     program to exit. A more centralized error handling strategy would be beneficial.
* Testing: There are no tests in the project. Adding unit tests for the service, storage, and multiplexer packages would significantly improve the project's
     robustness and make future refactoring safer.
* Configuration Validation: The config package does a good job of loading and validating the configuration. However, the validation could be more comprehensive. For
     example, it could check that the claude CLI is actually installed and available in the user's PATH.
* User Experience:
  * The kill command could benefit from a "dry-run" option to show which sessions would be killed without actually killing them.
  * The list command could have a --json flag to output the session list in a machine-readable format, which would be useful for scripting and integration with
         other tools.
