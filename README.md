## About The Project

Developers often work on multiple projects or tasks simultaneously, but Claude Code CLI instances are typically single-session and don't persist across terminal sessions. This makes it difficult to manage multiple conversations for different contexts and requires manual session management when switching between tasks.

**Claude Pilot** solves this by providing a session management system that allows developers to:

- Create and manage multiple named Claude Code sessions.
- Persist sessions across terminal restarts.
- Switch between different coding contexts seamlessly.
- Maintain session history and metadata.
- Organize work by project or task.

It's built with Go and leverages terminal multiplexers like `tmux` to provide a robust and familiar experience for power users. Support for `zellij` is planned for future releases.

-----

## Key Features

- **Multi-Session Management**: Create, list, and terminate multiple `claude code` CLI instances.
- **Interactive TUI**: Launch a full-featured Terminal User Interface with `claude-pilot tui` for interactive, mouse-supported session management.
- **Advanced Session Creation**: Attach new sessions as panes or windows/tabs to existing sessions, with control over split direction.
- **Session Persistence**: Session metadata is stored on your local machine and persists across application restarts.
- **Terminal Multiplexer Support**: Uses `tmux` for robust session management.
- **Detailed Session Information**: The `list` command shows session ID, name, status, creation time, panes, and more.
- **Unified Theming**: A beautiful, consistent Claude Orange theme is shared across both the CLI and TUI, built with `lipgloss`.
- **Named Sessions**: Give your sessions meaningful names to easily organize your work (e.g., `react-app`, `api-bug-fix`).
- **Intuitive CLI**: A clean, `tmux`-inspired command structure that is easy to learn and use.

-----

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You must have the following tools installed and available in your system's PATH:

1. **Claude CLI**: The `claude` command-line tool.
2. **Terminal Multiplexer**:
      - `tmux` (required)

### Installation

You can install Claude Pilot using `go install`:

```bash
go install github.com/HexSleeves/claude-pilot/packages/claudepilot@latest
```

Alternatively, you can build it from the source using the provided `Makefile`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HexSleeves/claude-pilot.git
cd claude-pilot
make build
sudo cp claude-pilot /usr/local/bin/
```

-----

## Usage

Claude Pilot provides a simple and powerful set of commands to manage your sessions.

### Core Commands

**`tui`**
Launches the interactive Terminal User Interface. This is the recommended way to use Claude Pilot for a visual experience.

```bash
claude-pilot tui
```

**`create [session-name]`**
Creates a new Claude session. If no name is provided, a timestamp-based name will be generated.

You can also attach to existing sessions as new panes or windows/tabs:

```bash
# Create a standalone session
claude-pilot create my-go-project

# Create session with description and project path
claude-pilot create --desc "React app" --project ./src

# Attach to existing session as a new pane (default: vertical split)
claude-pilot create debug --attach-to my-go-project --as-pane

# Attach as new pane with horizontal split
claude-pilot create debug --attach-to my-go-project --as-pane --split h

# Attach as new window/tab
claude-pilot create testing --attach-to my-go-project --as-window
```

**Attachment Options:**

- `--attach-to <session-name>`: Target session to attach to
- `--as-pane`: Create as new pane in existing session
- `--as-window`: Create as new window/tab in existing session
- `--split <direction>`: Split direction for panes (`h` for horizontal, `v` for vertical)

**`list`**
Lists all active and inactive sessions in a clean, tabular format.

```bash
claude-pilot list
```

**`attach <session-id|session-name>`**
Attaches to an existing session, allowing you to interact with Claude.

```bash
claude-pilot attach my-go-project
```

Inside the session, you can use standard multiplexer commands to detach (e.g., `Ctrl+B, D` for tmux).

**`kill <session-id|session-name>`**
Terminates a specific session. Use the `--all` flag to kill all sessions.

```bash
# Kill a specific session
claude-pilot kill my-go-project

# Kill all sessions with confirmation
claude-pilot kill --all
```

**`details <session-id|session-name>`**
Shows detailed information for a specific session.

```bash
claude-pilot details my-go-project
```

-----

## Architecture

Claude Pilot is designed with a modular, monorepo architecture to separate concerns and promote code reuse. The project is divided into four main packages: `claudepilot`, `core`, `shared`, and `tui`.

- **`packages/core`**: The heart of the application. This package contains all the core business logic, including:

  - **Service (`service/`)**: Manages session lifecycle (create, read, update, delete).
  - **Multiplexer (`multiplexer/`)**: An interface to communicate with `tmux`.
  - **Storage (`storage/`)**: Handles saving and retrieving session metadata from the filesystem as JSON.
  - **Configuration (`config/`)**: Manages application configuration via Viper.
  - **API (`api/`)**: A clean client-facing API that abstracts the core logic for consumers.

- **`packages/shared`**: Contains code shared between the CLI and TUI frontends.

  - **Interfaces (`interfaces/`)**: Defines the core data structures and service contracts.
  - **Styles (`styles/`)**: A unified, `lipgloss`-based styling system and theme (Claude Orange).
  - **Components (`components/`)**: Reusable UI components, like the session table, for both CLI and TUI.

- **`packages/claudepilot`**: The primary command-line interface.

  - Built with **Cobra**, it provides the main entry point for users to interact with the application (e.g., `claude-pilot create`, `list`, `attach`, `kill`).
  - It consumes the `core` package via its API layer to perform its operations.

- **`packages/tui`**: A rich, interactive Terminal User Interface (TUI).

  - Built with **Bubble Tea**, it offers a more visual and interactive way to manage sessions.
  - Like the `claudepilot` CLI, it is also a consumer of the `core` package's API.

This decoupled architecture allows for flexible development and makes it easier to maintain and extend the application's capabilities.
