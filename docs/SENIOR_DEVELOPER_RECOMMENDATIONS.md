**Action Items:**

- [ ] Add more defer statements for resource cleanup
- [ ] Implement connection pooling for tmux commands
- [ ] Add resource leak detection in development mode
- [ ] Implement proper shutdown handling

## ðŸŸ¢ Medium Priority Issues

### 7. Configuration Management - **LOW**

- **Current State**: Excellent Viper-based configuration
- **Target**: Enhanced configuration validation and caching

**Action Items:**

- [ ] Add comprehensive configuration validation
- [ ] Implement configuration change detection
- [ ] Add configuration caching for performance
- [ ] Implement hot configuration reloading

### 8. Logging and Observability - **LOW**

- **Current State**: Good structured logging
- **Target**: Enhanced observability with metrics and tracing

**Action Items:**

- [ ] Add performance metrics collection
- [ ] Implement distributed tracing
- [ ] Add pprof endpoints for profiling
- [ ] Implement health check endpoints

## Specific Code Examples

### Testing Structure

```go
// packages/core/internal/service/session_service_test.go
func TestSessionService_CreateSession(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name        string
        sessionName string
        description string
        expectError bool
    }{
        // Test cases...
    }
}
```

### Context Support

```go
// Add context to service methods
func (s *SessionService) CreateSession(ctx context.Context, name, description, projectPath string) (*interfaces.Session, error) {
    select {
    case <-ctx.Done():
        return nil, ctx.Err()
    default:
    }
    // ... existing logic
}
```

### Error Handling

```go
// Custom error types
type SessionNotFoundError struct {
    Identifier string
}

func (e *SessionNotFoundError) Error() string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("session '%s' not found", e.Identifier)
}
```

### Performance Optimization

```go
// Session status caching
type statusCache struct {
    cache map[string]cacheEntry
    mu    sync.RWMutex
}

type cacheEntry struct {
    status    interfaces.SessionStatus
    timestamp time.Time
}
